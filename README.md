# Predicting Bombay Stock Exchange Prices

I aim to predict the prices of stocks listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) using a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

In this project, we leverage the power of Random Forests and various NLP algorithms to analyze and predict stock prices. My primary focus is on stocks listed on the BSE, one of the largest and oldest stock exchanges in Asia.

## Methodology

My approach combines traditional machine learning techniques with modern NLP algorithms. We use the Random Forest algorithm from the sklearn Python library for my primary prediction model due to its robustness and ability to handle a large number of features.

For the NLP part, I analyze news articles and social media posts related to the stocks. This helps us understand the public sentiment and its potential impact on stock prices.

## Libraries Used

I extensively use Python for this project along with several libraries including:

- sklearn: For implementing the Random Forest algorithm and other machine learning models.
- Various NLP libraries: For processing and analyzing text data.

I hope you find this project interesting and useful. Feel free to explore the code, raise issues, and contribute.

HappyÂ Coding!
